# Secure-Door-Access-Server

This project has been created as part of third year university studies.

This server allows connection with scanner and client applications.

The scanner sends the card information over to this server where it is matched against the records. 
Once standard checks are completed, the response (allow/deny) is send back to the scanner.

This server also allows authentication/authorisation for the client application where the administrators are able to visualise the system factors.
